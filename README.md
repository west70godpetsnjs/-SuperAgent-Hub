# -SuperAgent-Hub
SuperAgent Hub is an open-source environment for creating and launching AI agents that can automate data research, track markets, and perform repetitive tasks.

The project is conceived as a central place where you can collect different agents: from simple scanners and alerts to more complex workflows related to crypto markets, analytics, and personal assistants.

The main idea is to provide a convenient framework for experimenting with multi-agent systems without having to write everything from scratch.

Notes

The project is experimental and is being developed gradually. It is suitable for both learning and building your own tools on top of the agent architecture.

It is not financial advice and does not imply completely autonomous trading without supervision.
